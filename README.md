# LMS2LZ - Learning Management System to Learning Zone Converter

LMS2LZ is a lightweight web-based tool that allows you to convert your content from the LMS format to the Learning Zone format. The tool is designed to simplify the process of migrating educational resources from one system to another, making it easier for the content team.

## How it Works

LMS2LZ leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform the conversion seamlessly. The tool takes advantage of the power of web technologies, allowing you to run it directly in your web browser without the need for any additional software or installations.

The conversion process is straightforward. You simply provide the URLs to your LMS content files, including the HTML, CSS, and JS files, and LMS2LZ will generate the converted LZ files. The converted LZ files will be structured and formatted in a way that is compatible with Learning Zone systems.
